# Switch Controlling Half of One Duplex Receptacle

This is a light switch to control the top half of a duplex receptable. The bottom half of the receptable is always energized, as is the duplex receptacle further downstream.

The **SwitchReceptaclesOneSwitchedSwitchLoop** circuit is similar to this one, except in a switch loop configuration, where the switch is furthest away from the feed.

Photo 1 shows the preparatory layout: feed (off the right edge) to switch (right), to the half-switched duplex receptable (middle) then onward to the always-on pair of outlets (left).
  * The duplex receptable in the middle (where one half will be switch-controlled) has had its hot connecting tab broken off.
    * Its neutral connecting tab was left intact, so as to provide a single, convenient neutral-return screw without pigtailing.

Photo 2 shows the circuit in operation.
  * The tester's light doesn't show up well, but it is lit when the switch is in the On position.
  * Not pictured, is this outlet going cold when the switch is in the Off position, and all 3 other outlets remaining hot at all times regardless of switch position.

Photo 4 shows the switch box.
  * Feed comes in on the right.
  * A 3-wire cable will carry on to the downstream receptacles.
    * White to white, ground to ground.
    * Black is pigtailed to the always-on black, and to the red wire via a switch.
      * In this case, I chose red as the wire for the switch-controlled outlet.
  * *The switch wires really were tightened properly during operation. This photo was taken as I was tearing down the circuit.*

Photo 3 shows the first duplex receptacle, where one outlet is controlled by the switch.
  * Again, the "hot side" connecting tab was removed, so the two outlets receive separate power.
  * Red comes from the switch to the top outlet (brass).
  * Black is pigtailed to connect to the lower half of this outlet (brass), as well as to the 2-wire cable going onward to the rest of the outlets.
  * White from the feed is connected to the "neutral side" (silver) nut, and the other silver nut connects to the cable onward to the next receptacle. This means one less pigtail inside this box.
  * Grounding wires both connect to grounding bolts on the chassis.
  * *The switch wires really were tightened properly during operation. This photo was taken as I was tearing down the circuit.*

Not pictured, is the far-side elctrical box with the always-hot duplex receptacle.
  * Both silver-side and brass-side connecting tabs were left intact.
  * White to silver, black to brass, ground to chassis bolt.
