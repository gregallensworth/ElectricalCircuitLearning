# Kitchen Receptacles

Kitchen countertop receptacles are required to be two separate circuit, of 20A apiece. Rather than run two lengths of cable next to each other, a 3-wire cable is used. Each alternating receptacle is connected to red, the others to black, and all of them share the one neutral return.

Photo 1 shows an overview of the circuit.
  * Feed comes in from the right, receptacles proceed to the left.
  * 3-wire cable is used at all steps.

Photo 2 and Photo 3 and Photo 4 show receptacle boxes for prepared to form "red circuit" and "black circuit"
  * On black receptacles, red simply patches to red, and black is left free for a duplex receptacle. On red receptacles, the opposite is true.
  * These duplex receptacles have a pair of hot (brass) nuts and a pair of neutral (silver) nuts, so "passing through" does not require any pigtailing.
  * Photo 4 shows the final receptacle in the chain (red circuit).
    * This could have been wired with 2-wire cable from the prior receptacle, but the wiring person mistakenly used 3-wire.
    * The extraneous wire is terminated with a wire nut, and electrical tape for good measure.
    * This isn't all bad, though, as it would be easier to add more receptacles to the circuit without "backtracking" and rewiring the previous connection.

Photo 5 is a close-up of one of the black receptacles wired up.
  * Simple black/red to brass, white to silver.
  * These duplex receptacles have a pair of hot (brass) nuts and a pair of neutral (silver) nuts, so "passing through" does not require any pigtailing.

However, after energizing the "kitchen" one of the outlets did not work. Referring to Photo 1, the third receptacle (from the right) was not working. Photo 6 shows why: in the previous receptacle, the wire nut connecting black to black to "pass through" had come undone as I was stuffing the receptacle and wire into the box.
  * A non-working receptacle may have a problem within that receptacle box, *or* it may be in the prior box.
  * If the problem is every other receptacle then it could be the breaker for that half of the receptacles.
  * If the problem is every other receptacle *starting at a certain point* ("works, works, works, no, works, no, works, no") then this is almost certainly a connection problem like this.
  * If all receptacles stop working after a certain point, then it would not be the breaker but a common path (neutral return) in either tha first non-working box, or else the box immediately preceeding.

Code violations and safety hazards in this circuit:
  * For a kitchen circuit, code requires 20A wiring (NM-12) and 20A receptacles (sockets have the side-notch). This has neither.
  * For a kitchen circuit, code requires GFCI receptacles. These are not.
