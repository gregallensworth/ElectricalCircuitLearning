# Kitchen Receptacles

Kitchen countertop receptacles are required to be two separate circuit, of 20A apiece. Rather than run two lengths of cable next to each other, a 3-wire cable is used. Each alternating receptacle is connected to red, the others to black, and all of them share the one neutral return.

Photo 2 shows an overview of the circuit.
  * Feed comes in from the right, receptacles proceed to the left.
  * 3-wire cable is used at all steps *except* between the last two boxes, at which 2-wire cable is used.

Photos 1 and 4 show the receptacle boxes forming "red circuit" and "black circuit"
  * On black-powered receptacles, red simply patches to red, and black powers the duplex receptacle. On red receptacles, the opposite is true.
  * Code specifies that in multiwire circuits like this, the receptacles *must not* be wired so that removal of the receptacle will disconnect power from the rest of the chain.
    * As such, the neutral and the "power wire" for each receptacle, are pigtailed to the receptacle.
    * In lighting and appliance branch circuits, though, taking that "easy way out" is allowable.

Photo 5 shows the final two boxes on the circuit.
  * These may be connected with 2-wire cable (the simple black-to-black connection).
  * Note the neutral pigtail on the next-to-last receptacle, again due to code requirement that the chain not be broken.

Photo 3 shows that the box can indeed tighten down nicely. It's a tight fit, though.
  * A 3 x 2 x 2.5" box is about 13 cubic inches.
  * 4 number 14 wires + 1 grounding connector + receptacle = 7 conductors
  * #14 wire is 2.0 ci, so 7 = 14 ci

Violations and hazards in this circuit:
  * For a kitchen circuit, code requires 20A wiring (12 AWG) and 20A receptacles (sockets have the side-notch). This has neither. In fact, the final receptacle isn't even a modern grounded receptacle.
  * For a kitchen circuit, code requires GFCI receptacles. These are not.
  * Not sure about the box fill calculations, especially if I had used proper AWG 12 cable which increases the fill to 17.75 ci.
