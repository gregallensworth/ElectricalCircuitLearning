# Three-Way Light Switch, Light in the Middle

Perhaps the most common three-way light-switch scenario, with a switch at either end of a hallway and the light in the middle.

When I first tried to memorize the circuit layout here, it seemed weird. But once I sat down with a switch and the wire, the logic off it fell right into place.
* Black goes to the common on both switches.
* Red just passes through, switch to switch.
* Black and red go to the two hot traveler nuts. In one case the black is an "honorary black" using white wire with tape.

Really simple, once I put my eyes and hands on it!

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
* The light is on when both switches match position, and off when the two switches are not in the same position.
* Feed is on the far right, and the light is in betwen the two switches.

Photo 2 shows the light fixture.
* Red passes through.
* Black to the light, and white (tagged as black) goes onward. This gives the light fixture a familiar "black and white" pair, while also warning that the white is hot.

Photo 3 and Photo 4 show the two switch boxes.
* Red and black to hot traveler nuts. On one switch the black is a repurposed (and tagged) white.
* "Real" black to common.
