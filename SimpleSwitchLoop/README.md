# Simple Switch Loop

This is a simple light switch and bulb, but in the "switch loop" configuration in which the feed connects to the light, then onward to the switch.

Photo 2 shows it working, and gives an overview of the circuit layout.
  * Feed into the light box, then onward to the switch.

Photo 1 gives a closeup of the light box.
  * Feed comes in from the right. Switch is to the left.
  * White to white, typical.
  * Out to the switch, black is black as usual. This connects to the light fixture's own black, so the light fixture has a very clear black and white even if one had no other context.
  * The white wire to the switch, is acting as a surrogate black. It connects to the feed's black and is tagged with tape as a hot "honorary black".

Photo 3 shows a closeup of the switch box.
  * The white wire is really black, and is tagged to indicate such.

Errors in this circuit
  * At the light fixture's box, only one of the two grounding wires is attached. The grounding wire from the switch box came loose, so the other end of this grounding wire (in the switch box) isn't really grounded at all.
