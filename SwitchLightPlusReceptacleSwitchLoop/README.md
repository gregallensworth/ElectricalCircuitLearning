# Switch Controlling a Light, Plus Always-Hot Receptacle

A light switch controls a light fixture, but the duplex receptacle on the same circuit is always hot. The switch comes at the end of the circuit, furthest from the feed panel.

The **SwitchLightPlusReceptacle** and **SwitchLightPlusReceptacle2** circuits are very similar in outcome, though they have the switches at the start of the circuit.

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
  * Not pictured, is that when the switch is in the Off position the light is off but this receptacle is still powered.

Photo 4 shows the light fixture's box, which is where the feed enters.
  * Black just passes through, and is always hot.
  * Red is the switch return, and thus the light fixture's hot. Note the black tag.
  * White neutral is passed through without a pigtail, thanks to this light fixture having extra screws.

Photo 3 shows the receptacle box, in the middle of the chain.
  * The always-hot black powers to this receptacle, and is also passed through to the switch in the next box.
  * Red was decided as the light's hot, so is connected to the switch return.
    * Note the black tape on both the white and the red, indicating hot.

Photo 2 shows the switch box.
  * Nothing interesting here: white and black wires from the nearest box (receptacle box), simply feed back to that same box.
  * White is tagged as hot, as is typical for a switch.

Errors in this circuit:
* For the switch box I didn't use an appropriately-sized box, and would need an appropriate cover plate.
