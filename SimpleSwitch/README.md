# Simple Switch

A simple light switch circuit, with the feed connecting to a switch, and the switch to the light.

Photo 2 shows it simply working, with the light shining with the switch in the On position.

Photo 3 shows the electrical box for the light.
  * White to white on silver, black to black on brass.
  * Ground to a screw in the box.
  * The black isn't really stcking out from the light base as much as it looks. That's a trick of perspective, catching the reflection of the wire in the copper.

  * Ground to the chassis with a bolt, and also connected to the rest of the line.
  * White to white, and black interrupted by the switch.
