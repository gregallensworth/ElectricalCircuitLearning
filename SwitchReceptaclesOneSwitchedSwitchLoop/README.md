# Switch-Controlled Half-Receptacle in Switch Loop Layout

This is similar to the **SwitchHalfReceptacle** circuit, in which a switch controls one outlet of a duplex receptacle, while other receptacles stay hot regardless of switch position.

Photo 3 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
  * The feed comes in from the far right.
  * The switch-controlled socket is the bottom half of the duplex receptacle on the far right.
  * Not pictured, is that this socket correctly turns off when the switch is in the Off position, and that the other 3 outlets are always hot regardless of switch position.

Photo 2 shows the receptacle box closest to the source. This one contains the half-switched receptacle.
  * Feed is pictured on the left.
  * The duplex receptacle here, has had its brass-side connecting tab broken.
  * White connects to white, using the still-connected silver screws on the duplex receptacle.
  * Black from the feed, is pigtailed the one always-hot outlet on this receptacle, and also to the black on the 3-wire cable onward.
  * The switch-controlled outlet is connected to the red wire. This will go on downstream and ultimately connect to a switch.

Photo 1 shows the "middle" box, containing an always-hot duplex receptacle and then connecting onward to a switch.
  * The always-hot black is connected to this receptacle, and also onward to the switch using the extra brass screws on the receptacle.
  * The white neutral connects to the duplex receptacle, and ends here.
  * The red wire for the switch-controlled outlet, is connected over to the switch box's white cable.
    * This is the switch's return.
    * This white cable being switch-controlled and not neutral, is tagged with black tape.

Photo 4 shows the switch box, at the very end of the chain.
  * A 2-wire cable comes in, and the white is tagged as black since it's always hot.
  * Both wires go back to the "middle" box with the always-hot receptacle.
