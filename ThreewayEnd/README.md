# Three-Way Light Switch, Light at the End

A three-way light-switch scenario, in which the light is at the far end of the circuit from the feed, and the two switches connect directly together between the feed and the light.

That is to say: the feed, the two switches on the wall, and the light fixture are positioned such that it made more sense to run the two switches and then up to the light, rather than from a wall switch to the ceiling, then back down to the wall. In a larger setting than a residential hallway, such as a warehouse or workshop, this could make a lot of sense.

This is virtually identical to the light-in-middle **ThrewayMiddle** circuit, but with one twist:
* At the switch connecting to the light, it is the *common* black which goes to the light, and not one of the hot traveler nuts.

Photo 2 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
* Feed is on the far right, and both switches come before the light fixture.
* The light is on when both switches match position, and off when the two switches are not in the same position.

Photo 1 shows the light fixture and the second switch.
* The first switch is not shown here. It is wired identically to the **ThreewayMiddle** circuit: hot black to common, three-wire cable connecting black and red to move onward.
* Light fixture uses a 2-wire cable, plain black and white bass and silver as usual.
* Second switch has a twist from the previous circuit: it is the light fixture's black which connects to the common, and the "true hot" black from the prior switch goes to the traveler.
