# Double Gang Switch Controlling Lights, Switch Loop Layout

Like the **DoubleGangLights** circuit, a double-gang switch box controls a pair of light fixture, one light per switch.

However, this one does so in a switch loop layout, placing the switch box at the far end of the circuit from the feed.

Photos 5 and 6 show the circuit in operation, and give an overview.
  * Feed comes in from the far right, into the light box on the right ("near" fixture). This connects to a second light fixture ("far" fixture) and then to the switch box.

Photo 1 shows the feed and the "near" fixture.
  * White neutral is connected through, using this lighting fixture's convenient pair of silver screws.
  * Power to this fixture will come from the red wire.
    * It was arbitrary choice on my part to make the near fixture the "red circuit"
    * Tagged with black tape for an extra visual cue that it's hot.
  * Black is connected to black. This will go out to the second fixture, then to the switch. Its return from the switch will be on the red wire.
  * Grounding wires from the feed and from the downstream cable, are both grounded to the chassis.

Photo 2 shows the second fixture, which connects to the switch.
  * Not only does this box provide power to this light fixture, it also connects onward to the switch box *and* provides the red wire return to the near fixture.
  * A 3-wire cable is sent to the switch box.
    * White is tagged with black tape and connected to the black feed. This forms the common power feed.
    * The red switch return wire will go back to the near fixture, where the red wire (tagged black) provides power.
    * The black switch return wire is used for this fixture.
  * The white neutral from the feed and the near fixture, terminates here at the far light fixture.
  * Grounding wires are joined.

Photo 3 shows the switch box at the far end.
  * The hot-white (tagged with tape) forms a common source for both switches. Note the white in and two blacks out.
  * The switches then use the red and black wires of the 3-wire cable, as switch returns as described in photo 2.

Photo 4 shows the grounding situation inside the switch box.
  * Had a metal box been used, switches would ground to the chassis via their screws and the grounding wire would be basically redundant.
  * With a plastic box, switches will not automatically ground to the chassis by their screws, so grounding wires must be used.
