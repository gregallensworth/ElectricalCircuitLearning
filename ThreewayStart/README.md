# Three-Way Light Switch, Light at the Start

A three-way light-switch scenario, in which the light is at the feed end of the circuit, and the two switches connect directly together later on down the line.

That is to say: the feed, the two switches on the wall, and the light fixture are positioned such that it made more sense to run out to the light fixture and then to the two switches. In a larger setting than a residential hallway, such as a warehouse or workshop, this could make a lot of sense.

This is similar in outcome to the **ThrewayMiddle** and **ThreewayEnd** circuits.

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
* Feed is on the far right, connecting to the light fixture. Both switches come after the light fixture.
* The light is on when both switches match position, and off when the two switches are not in the same position.

Photo 2 shows the light fixture box.
* 2-wire cable is used to connect to the switches.
* The bulb gets a visible black-and-white brass-and-silver setup, so it's entirely ordinary.
* The black feed wire connects to white. This white becomes a "honorary black" all the way down the line to the final switch.
  * That is to say, the only true neutral return in this whole circuit, is the connection from the light fixture back to the feed. All other white wires here are actually hot and used to connect the switches.

Photos 3 and 4 show the switch boxes. Photo 3 is the middle switch between the light fixture and the far switch.
* 3-wire cable is used to connect switch to switch.
* Again, white is used here as a surrogate hot wire and is tagged black. It just passes through the first box and on to the second, where it connects as the "true hot black" to common.
* Red and true-black both connect to traveler nuts.
