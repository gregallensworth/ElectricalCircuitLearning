# Switch Controlling a Light, Plus Always-Hot Receptacle

This is just like **SwitchLightPlusReceptacle2** in that a light switch controls a light fixture, but the duplex receptacle on the same circuit is always hot. However, here the always-hot duplex receptacle comes after the switch and before the light.

`Feed -> Switch -> Receptacle -> Light`

The **SwitchLightPlusReceptacle2** with the receptacle after the light fixture, requires 3-wire cable all the way, with red "passing through" the light fixture's box to the receptacle. Here, the span from receptacle box to light box can be made with 2-wire cable.

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
  * Not pictured, is that when the switch is in the Off position the light is off but this receptacle is still powered.

Photo 4 shows the light fixture's electrical box.
  * Black to brass, whie to silver.

Photo 2 shows the switch box.
  * Hot black is pigtailed to both the ongoing black (always hot) and to a switch to the red wire (switch controlled).
  * White to white. Both ground wires to grounding nuts in the box.

Photo 3 shows the rceptacle's box.
  * The switch-controlled red is meant for the light fixture, and passes through to the black wire of the ongoing 2-wire cable.
  * Always-hot black terminates at this receptacle.
  * This receptacle has two nuts, so white neutral can pass through without an extra pigtail.
