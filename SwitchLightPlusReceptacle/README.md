# Switch Controlling a Light, Plus Always-Hot Receptacle
### Feed-Switch-Light-Receptacle Layout

A light switch controls a light fixture, but the duplex receptacle on the same circuit is always hot.

Here, the switch comes before the light, and the light box then connects to the receptacle.

The **SwitchLightPlusReceptacleFirst** circuit is very similar, except that the receptacle and light fixture switch positions.

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
  * Not pictured, is that when the switch is in the Off position the light is off but this receptacle is still powered.

Photo 4 shows the switch box.
  * Feed comes in at the top-right.
  * Ground is connected to ground. White is connected to white.
  * Feed black is connected to the red wire of a 3-wire cable (always hot), and to the black wire of that 3-wire cable (interrupted by switch).
    * The choice here was arbitary on my part, that red is always-hot.

Photo 2 shows the light box.
  * Black incoming wire connects to light fixture (brass screw).
  * White neutral is pigtailed, all three together: feed, onward-moving 2-wire cable, and light.
    * Equally valid would have been to use the light fixture's second silver neutral screw, and save a pigtail. In this case I had insufficient wire to do so.
  * The always-hot red is connected to the 2-wire cable leading onward to the receptacle.
  * Grounding wires are connected to grounding nuts on chassis.

Photo 3 shows the receptacle at the end of the chain.
  * Connectd to the black wire (to brass) and white neutral (silver) on the 2-wire cable from the light fixture box.
  * Was in a hurry and using a too-short piece of leftover cable, so not a nice job. See the errors section.

Errors in this circuit
  * The receptacle isn't in an electrical box.
  * The cable feeding the receptacle doesn't have nearly enough stripped wire, to be worked easily.
  * The end of the 2-wire cable in thee light box, has insufficient length for easy working.
