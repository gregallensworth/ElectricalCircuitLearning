# Double Gang Light Switches

A double-gang switch box, with each switch controlling a separate light fixture. These are in standard confgiguration, with the feed coming into the switch box before proceeding to the light fixtures.

Photos 2 and 3 show the lights and switches doing exactly as intended. They also give some overview of the layout.

Photo 1 shows the switch box.
  * Feed cable comes in at the lower-right.
    * White neutral just connects to white neutral.
  * Black is pigtailed out to both switches. A 3-wire cable will then carry black and red to two fixtures.
    * The decision whether red or black will power the near or far fixture, is entirely arbitrary? In this case, I chose that red would power the far fixture and black the nar fixture.

Photo 4 shows the light fixtures.
  * For the near fixture (right side) there are 3 wires in from the feed. Black was chosen to power this first fixture, and red to power the far fixture.
    * Feed black connects to this light's black (brass nut).
    * Feed red passes through to the further fixture.
  * White neutral is all three: feed neutral conncts to both this bulb's neutral and the remote wire's neutral.
    * Equally valid would have been to connect the white from both wires, to the fixture's convenient *pair* of neutral nuts, rather than use a pigtail.
  * Ground is wired to ground. In this case the grounding nut was not used, but instead the feed cable's ground wire.
  * The terminating light fixture (left side), is simply black to brass and white to silver.

Errors in this circuit
  * In the far fixture (photo 4, left side) the grounding wire isn't attached well.
