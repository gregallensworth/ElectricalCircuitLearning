# Switch Controlling a Light, Plus Always-Hot Receptacle
### Feed-Switch-Receptacle-Light Layout

A light switch controls a light fixture, but the duplex receptacle on the same circuit is always hot.

Here, the switch comes before the receptacle, and the recptacle box connects onward to the light box.

The **SwitchLightPlusReceptacle** circuit is very similar, except that the receptacle and light fixture switch positions.

Photo 1 shows the circuit in operation, and gives an overview.
  * The indicated receptacle (left, bottom outlet) is powered when the switch is on the On position.
  * Not pictured, is that the other 3 outlets are always hot regardless of the switch position.

Photo 2 shows the switch box.
  * Whie goes to white.
  * Black goes onward to the black wire of the 3-wire cable, and is always hot.
  * Black is connected to the red wire of the 3-wire cable, with the switch in the way. Thus, the red wire is switch-controlled.
    * The choice of red for switch, was arbitrary my part.

Photo 4 shows the switch-controlled duplex receptacle, and onward to the other downstream receptacle.
  * The 3-wire cable from the switch, comes in on the left. The right-side cable goes onward to the downstream receptacle.
  * White connects to white, using the two screws on the silver side of the duplex receptacle.
    * Connecting tab was left intact here, so we don't need to pigtail.
  * Red (from the switch) goes to the brass side of the one outlet we want switch-controlled.
  * Black is pigtailed to both the downstream 2-wire cable to the next receptacle, and the remaining outlet on the duplex receptacle.

Photo 3 shows the receptacle further downstream.
  * Nothing interesting here. Black to brass, white to silver, ground to chassis bolt.

Errors in this circuit
  * The terminating receptable (photo 3) is in an inappropriate electrical box, and would need a cover plate.
  * At the switch box (photo 2) look at the white neutral wire. That's a nick in the insulation, exposing the neutral wire.
